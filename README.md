## Problem Statement

1. **Lack of engagement and understanding**: Traditional teaching methods can be tedious, leading to a lack of engagement and understanding among students.

2. **Exclusion of specially-abled students**: These methods often overlook the needs of specially-abled students, making it challenging for them to access educational materials.

3. **Imagination limitations**: Abstract concepts can be difficult to grasp solely through traditional teaching methods, limiting students' imagination and comprehension.

4. **Physical limitations**: Students with physical disabilities may face difficulties in accessing educational materials, hindering their learning process.

## Our Solution

To address these challenges, our AR education app provides the following features:

1. **3D Interactive Modelling**: We incorporate 3D models to enhance students' imagination and understanding of various concepts, particularly those related to science and geography. Each 3D model is supplemented with text descriptions, providing a basic understanding of the subject matter.

2. **Text Supported by Audio**: For learners with visual impairments or reading disabilities, we provide audio descriptions synchronized with the 3D models. This enables them to access educational content effectively and interactively.

3. **Sign Language Support**: We understand the importance of inclusive learning, and to cater to students who prefer sign language, our app includes expert-made videos in sign language for each subject. This ensures that all students can benefit from the educational content provided.

## Conclusion

Our solution aims to create an all-round learning platform using augmented reality, accessible to students of all abilities. By combining interactive 3D models, text supported by audio, and sign language support, we strive to enhance engagement, understanding, and inclusivity in education.
